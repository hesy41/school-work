This repo is used to store all my school work including homework and labs:)

CISC1600 Computer Science I - Fordham university  
Instructor: Nikitas P. Kounavelis
Time: Fall 2020  
General introduction to Computer Science and the fundamental principles of computer programming using the C++ programming language.
The course introduces the process of developing algorithms to solve problems and the corresponding process of developing computer programs to express those algorithms.

CISC2000 Computer Science II - Fordham university  
Instructor: Julie Harazduk  
Time: Spring 2021  
This course is a more advanced course based on CISC1600 introducing C++ language concepts mainly about classes.

CISC2200 Data Structures - Fordham university  
Instructor: Mohamed Rahouti  
Time: Fall 2020  
A survey of the major types of structures in programs used to handle data. Methods for data organization and access will be covered across data structures and studied for their memory footprints and temporal efficiencies. This course builds on principles in discrete mathematics and in fundamental programming practices.

CISC 3593 Computer Organization - Fordham university
Instructor: Dakota Hernandez  
Time: Fall 2020  
This course introduces students to basic concepts in computer organization. It covers binary, octal and hex arithmetic, digital logic, machine and assembly language programming and processor architecture. Students are expected to have had introductory classes in programming and in discrete math. Course assignments will include a focus on both theoretical and practical issues and will include programming assignments.
